GAME OVERVIEW

This game was made as part of the Computer Graphics module from the Computer Games Technology MSc at City, University of London.
All textures, models and fonts used as part of this work are credited and referenced where possible at the end of this document. 

The project was built using a template provided by the Computer Games Technology course director. All object classes and shaders were built using code based 
on example code from lectures and lab exercises. All game logic is original work by me.

The aim of the game is to collect as many stars as possible in the shortest amount of time. Colliding into cubes forfeits points, and at each lap, the speed of the 
player increases making it harder to collect the stars. The level will end when all stars are collected, and the player can view their final score and time.
NOTE: If the game becomes too fast, please close and restart.
